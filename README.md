# WebServer
2 - Networking class web server (final project)

This is the final project for my Networking class coded Autumn 2015. The FTPClient was an extention to the webserver that I took out, and thus is not necessary/functioning in this version of code. plus most of the code in this file was premade by our professor. 

The server itself is very simple - enter "make" to make the java files, "java WebServer" to begin the server, and then in a browser you can use "http://localhost:6789/Stuff/helloWorld.html" or "http://localhost:6789/Stuff/embeddedPictures.html" (or replace [localhost] with [127.0.0.1]) to access the pages via HTTP requests.
